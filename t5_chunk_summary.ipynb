            "The Tribunal held: (1 ) that there were in the region no ' other concerns in the same line of business which could be compared with the respondent but that there were three collieries, a steel plant, a cement factory and an aluminum company in the region which were comparable with the resportdent, that as the minimum wage in those industries which was about Rs. 95 was above that of the respondent, a revision of the minimum wage in the respondent mills was justified.\n",

            "So, the Tribunal was right in directing that the revised wages should take effect from 13th December, 1962, in view of the considerable rise in the price index and the fact that the labour had not raised a fresh dispute for a further revision of wages since the date of the award.\n",
